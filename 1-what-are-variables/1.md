# What are Variables? Exercise 1

In this exercise we will use a variable to assign to a string of characters, and then we will print the characters out. A string of characters can be represented using single quotes or double quotes

> you can also use the back tick to represent multiple lines of strings of characters

Create the variable `hw` and assign the string of characters `Hello World`
